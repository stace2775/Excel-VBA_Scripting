'Description:
'   This script will look at the Stock Data spreadsheet, loop through Ticker info on each sheet
'   and return a summary of Ticker Names, corresponding totals,  & the percent change from opening to closing.
'
'   This script assumes:
'       1.  col A is sorted by value and has no breaks/blanks
'       2.  col B is sorted by ascending dates
'       3.  Yearly Change column is supposed to show 9 decimal places
